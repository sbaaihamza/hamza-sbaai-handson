However, if you know what groups you would like to have, then you can feed many examples of each group to a classification algorithm (supervised learning), and it will classify all your customers into these groups."

We usually train such systems by **minimizing a cost function** that measures how bad the system is at making predictions on the training data,** plus a penalty for model complexity if the model is regularized**. To make predictions, we feed the new instance’s features into the model’s prediction function, using the parameter values found by the learning algorithm."

    "**Answer**: If a model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, the model is likely overfitting the training data (or we got extremely lucky on the training data). Possible solutions to overfitting are getting more data, simplifying the model (selecting a simpler algorithm, reducing the number of parameters or features used, or regularizing the model), or reducing the noise in the training data."
